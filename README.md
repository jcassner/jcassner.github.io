## Projects üõ†Ô∏è
### Tableau Visualization
[Undergraduate School Selection Tool](https://public.tableau.com/views/UndergraduateSchoolSelectionTool2014/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Description: I developed a dashboard utilizing data from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to assist newly-graduated high school seniors in answering important questions for their postsecondary school selection. Topics explored included the cost impact of staying in the state of residence or not, the size of the last incoming freshman class, and which placement test score was most commonly submitted. Visualizations range from comparable lists, bar graphs, and proportional symbol mapping and all were capbable of user refinement.

### Python Modeling 
[Titanic Survival Modeling](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IQEN1uDtvU4QhoE2azQp26aRt9qtEPzw#scrollTo=ZNNFl4YmM-Tq)

Description: I completed this python-based final project to predict the survivability of Titanic passengers based on the given predictors. The exercise showcases my dive into data exploration, data preprocessing, null value evaluation, logistic regression analyses, evaluation metrics, and model diagnostics. This course was my first step into machine learning using the python language and I believe it set a solid foundation on which to build more in-depth techniques.

### R Modeling
[Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Common Well-Being Search Terms](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18431560/COVID-19.Lockdown.Effect.on.Search.Terms.docx)

Description: I investigated time series data on common well-being search terms, such as boredom, divorce, sadness, and stress, and their relation to the timing of the United States COVID-19 lockdown. Time series plots were first created in R spanning two different years over 3 states to visualize the layout of the data. A regression model was then able to be utilized by using the fixed effects ordinary least squares technique on the panel data. Lastly, running a clustering analysis on each search term by day reveals any significance of their changes between the two years after the lockdown timing.
