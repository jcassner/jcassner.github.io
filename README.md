## Projects üõ†Ô∏è
### Machine Learning
[Data Preprocessing & EDA]()

[SkyMart Sales Predictive Modeling]()

<a href="SkyMart_Final_Report.docx" download>Final Report</a>

Description: SkyMart is a leader in the United States retail business sector with over 45 stores nationwide and sought to uncover valuable insights from newly gathered data relating to their business performance. Their main goal was to develop a predictive model to best forecast future sales of their company while also pulling insights of individual store's sales performance, deciphering seasonal fluctuations to improve inventory preparedness, and determining if external factors have a major effect on overall sales. Key steps in delivering on SkyMart's requests involved an in-depth data wrangling & cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and evaluation. 
* **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**: Datasets were procured through a Kaggle library and combined to facilitate target and feature inclusion. Datatypes were transformed into more usable types (e.g., date fields changed to datetime and parsed, binary fields encoded appropriately), feature engineering was performed to combine similar features, and null values were investigated and imputed.
* **EDA**: Univariate analysis of all features revealed skewed distributions of some, which were transformed via natural log and boxcox transformations to best prepare the data for linear regression implemntation. Bivariate analysis of relationships between predictor features and the target was then performed and resulted in the knowledge that their relationship was not strongly linear. Potential use of non-linear models was noted due to that finding. Store performances were determined by analyzing store sales figures over time to pinpoint high- and low-performing stores. Seasonality was determined by decomposing sales figures over time and revealing late-year spikes and early-year lulls.
* **Data Modeling**: The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets and both were standardized to account for different measurement scales. Each model investigated was evaluated on its coefficient of determination (R2 value), root mean squared error (RMSE), and plotting residuals. A multiple linear regression  including all predictor features was first performed and yielded very subpar results, confirming the lack of linearity of the data. Pivoting to non-linear models, a polynomial regression was then conducted which yielded slightly better metrics (R2: 0.385; RMSE: $442,143) but far from preferred outcomes. More complex non-linear models were needed and so decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost were then investigated. Each of these three models were tuned to their best hyperparameters, their least valuable features were recursively eliminated, and then each tuned model was fitted onto their preferred features.
* **Evaluation**: Based on the metrics of R2 value, RMSE, and plotting residuals with the consideration given to computing time, it was determined that XGBoost was the best model to recommend for future use with this dataset. Its R2 value was 0.975, its RMSE was $88,829, its residual plot was the least variable, and it did not overly tax the computing system. Future work was also determined and communicated back to SkyMart.

### Tableau Visualization
[Undergraduate School Selection Tool](https://public.tableau.com/views/UndergraduateSchoolSelectionTool2014/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Description: I developed a dashboard utilizing data from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to assist newly-graduated high school seniors in answering important questions for their postsecondary school selection. Topics explored included the cost impact of staying in the state of residence or not, the size of the last incoming freshman class, and which placement test score was most commonly submitted. Visualizations range from comparable lists, bar graphs, and proportional symbol mapping and all were capbable of user refinement.

### R Modeling
[Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Common Well-Being Search Terms](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18431560/COVID-19.Lockdown.Effect.on.Search.Terms.docx)

Description: I investigated time series data on common well-being search terms, such as boredom, divorce, sadness, and stress, and their relation to the timing of the United States COVID-19 lockdown. Time series plots were first created in R spanning two different years over 3 states to visualize the layout of the data. A regression model was then able to be utilized by using the fixed effects ordinary least squares technique on the panel data. Lastly, running a clustering analysis on each search term by day reveals any significance of their changes between the two years after the lockdown timing.
