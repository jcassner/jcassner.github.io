#### Description: I developed a dashboard utilizing data from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to assist newly-graduated high school seniors in answering important questions for their postsecondary school selection. Topics explored included the cost impact of staying in the state of residence or not, the size of the last incoming freshman class, and which placement test score was most commonly submitted. Visualizations range from comparable lists, bar graphs, and proportional symbol mapping that were all capbable of refinement.
